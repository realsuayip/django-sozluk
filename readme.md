This is a clone of ekşi sözlük. Commonly referred as "collaborative dictionary",
this type of social networking can be thought as "urban dictionary on steroids". Visit
[this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ek%C5%9Fi_S%C3%B6zl%C3%BCk) to learn more about
this type of social network.

### Quick installation

Make sure you have latest versions of Python and Docker installed in your system. Clone
files via Git/GitHub, in the root directory run this command:

    python docker.py up

This will build and start development server for the project. Keep in mind that
in production mode, the emails will output into console (container logs).

Running in development mode will also create a superuser with email `test@django.org` and password
`test`. In order for your entries to appear, you need to make yourself an actual author i.e., 
remove yourself from novice status using admin user edit page.

The website uses cache mechanism frequently, so you may be inclined to disable
caching using a dummy cache backend, or disabling cache on left frame. Check settings
on `apps.py` to learn about caching and about all the other settings.

The Python script also allows
for a production setup, run `python docker.py --help` to learn more.

### Standard docker usage
If you prefer not use the helper script to gain more granular control, make sure you specify
the right compose file. Use this command to build and serve:

    docker-compose up -d

Initially, you also have to run a script (in the web container) that sets up the
database, collects static files and generates required users for the dictionary app:

    docker-compose exec web sh scripts/setup.sh

You are most likely to create an admin account after these processes:

    docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser

If you intend to use this configuration for production, make sure you have
edited all the `.env` files, Django settings file (`settings_prod.py`) and 
dictionary settings file (`dictionary/apps.py`) with proper credentials.
Make sure you change the passwords of users that are generated
through `setup.sh` script.
